The author of the blog article was not totally consistent in the way they conveyed the data.  Four formats capture more than 99% of the list.  The remainder amount to a few entries, so rather than code up every last permutation, we'll just throw those out, as it will have an insignificant effect on the statistics we will generate later.\n",

Typically, in Spanish, nouns ending in \"o\" are masculine and words ending in \"a\" are feminine.  But not always.  *While \"palabro\" is not a word, but is meant to show that when it is used in these last two formats, the word ending in \"o\" is always masculine in these cases.*\n",
